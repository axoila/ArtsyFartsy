      to true>>\n\nBased on choices, you can set variables, and then check those variables
      later.\n<<if $didOption2 is true>>\nBy checking $didOption2, I remember you
      chose option 2!\n<<else>>\nI can't detect a variable $didOption2, so that means
      you chose option 1\n<<endif>>\n\nDo you want to go back to Start now?\n-> Yes,

      the end, good luck!"
